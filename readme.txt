== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the user doesn't receive the confirmation email? =

Make sure you have selected "Email" as the "Type" when defining the form fields in the options page. This is important and have two benefits : First, you'll be sure that the user has to put a correctly formatted email address. And second, you'll be sure that the user receives the confirmation/thank you email.

= What if I wanted a bigger data table? =

It can be easily achieved by making a slight change in 2 lines of the main file. If that is the case for you, just drop me a line and I'll be more than happy to help:)

== Addittional Info ==

When you start to receive data via your form, the data will be displayed in the backend table in the same sequence that is being received from frontend. The table headers are the names that you define when setting up the form fields. So the received data corresponds to their names on the table header. 
However if you ever decided to change the sequence of the fields and/or change the field names later, then you're actually change the sequence and/or name of the table headers as well, keep in mind that the sequence of the data stored in the table remains the same; this is because the data is being displayed from the database and the sequence of data is not changed in database. So if you decided to change the name and/or sequence of the field names and wanted to have the data correspond to the table headers again, then you'll have to manually edit the data by clicking "Edit" button on each row.
